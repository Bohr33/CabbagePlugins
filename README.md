# CabbagePlugins
A collection of my Cabbage plugins and other audio tools.
There are some older versions for each plugin. I recommend downloading which ever has the latest version number.

To install any component plugins, you must drop them in your computers component audio folder. To do this..

1. Open a finder window
2. In the top options bar, find GO.
3. While hovering over go, hold down the "Option" key to reveal the hidden library folder and enter it.
4. From here, navigate to Audio/Plug-Ins/Components
5. Finally, copy the component file into this directory.
